title: I was given the FIRE green light

  <p>In the last few months, I was contemplating my ideas on how to actually evaluate my portfolio for FIRE readiness. I know my numbers (my expense tracking trial of 2 years is coming to an end in December), I know how to diversify my portfolio, but I am still not sure if everything is at the right place.</p>

  <p>Luckily, I knew just the person to talk to, so earlier in August, I contacted Karsten Jeske, the author of the Earlyretirementnow blog. He was happy to take my case and we scheduled a call for late September. By then, I actually managed to set up a daily portfolio valuation tracker (now available on the homepage), so I knew a bit more about how I performed since September last year.</p>

  <p>Anyway, I had this call with Karsten, who went through my asset allocations, showed me his ETF comparison tool (it tracks over 190 ETFs for correlation, 10+ year performance in the past, etc.). He concluded that if I stick to a 24-26k EUR/month budget, I should be safe even in a 50-year time horizon. His main bits of advice were the following:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Consider adding a 7-10 year treasury bond into the bond part of the portfolio. His argument was that if long-term inflation ticks around 2.4%, then the 4.1% nominal interest is actually 1.7% of real return. It is good enough for bonds, and it should help with my bond glide path too — meaning that I start with more bonds now and gradually shift towards more equities in the next 5 years.
    </li>
    <li>
      Related to the bond side, he also emphasised that while going for a 70-30 portfolio is good, a 60-40 could be even safer with the current valuation levels. Again, I may only get 1-2% real return from the stock market in the next few years, so I may as well get that from bonds.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, he gave me some ideas on the currency risk — since 80% of my spending is in forint — he suggested I buy some local bonds. Luckily, ÁKK just released a new set of bonds paying 7% nominal interest, so I will probably buy some of those to have a bit of forint liquidity as well.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>At the end of the conversation, he said that “Adam, you seem to be ready to FIRE, so just hang on tight and then enjoy your early retirement”.</p>

  <p>Thanks, Karsten, I will just do that.</p>
