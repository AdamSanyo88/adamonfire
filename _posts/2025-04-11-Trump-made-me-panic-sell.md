<p>So I was right about the markets being too high up. The only problem was that I didn't expect them to come down like this. <strong>Trump with his billboard show managed to make everything plunge in just 7 days</strong>. I was actually cautious about this and sold a portion of my Nasdaq-100 ETF and bought gold instead.<p/>
<p>However, what came after Trump's announcement even shocked me. At the bottom of the market, I even sold some of my S&P500 ETF - about 12% of my total position -, because I felt "this is over, that was it". And then, not so surprisingly, they announced a 90-day pause to the tariffs. And then Trump bragged in the White House about how his friends "made billions" on basically doing some insider trading 20 minutes before they announced the 90-day delay. It really feels like the US executive leadership is playing politics as if they were in Hungary or in some other authoritarian government. Anyway, now my goal is clear for this year; I must reposition my portfolio a bit away from the US and probably buy some European ETFs.</p>
<p>I remember going to one of the free investment forum events in December where I asked a portfolio manager about what investors should do in 2025, and he said "just buy European stocks". I didn't believe him, but looks like he got things at a 15% discount. And it's true that Europe has a weaker growth potential - especially with the war in Ukraine still going on -, but at least European leaders are not running their countries like Trump runs the US. I wonder how the USA's world dominance will fare under these conditions, because I'm sure the next 4 years will be bumpier than Trump's first 4 years were...</p>
