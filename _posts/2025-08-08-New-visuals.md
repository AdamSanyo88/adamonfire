<p>I received some very good feedback from some strangers in the FIRE community Several people explained to me that the real value of my FIRE journey is the transparency around it meaning that I shared my journey with numbers, explanation on what I purchased, etc.<p/>
<p>For most people, talking about their money and choices may feel uncomfortable as it would make them a target of criticism. However, I actually got used to being a target. Ever since my childhood, I was the weird kid who didn't want to follow the social norms. Of course, this had its downsides as I was alone quite a lot. But more recently, I found that being an analyst and focusing on the numbers and logical explanations, that's actually a strength and not a weakness.</p>
<p>So I decided to be even more transparent about how I invest my money and the homepage of the site will show the changes every month. This way I hope people can get some inspiration on what I do and it also gives me an additional accountability that my portfolio should be managed well as now it's not just me who gets to know how my decisions had turned out. For the next few months, my goal will be to reduce my technology focus a little bit, I still believe in the power of tech stocks, but I also want to be sensible about my approach. Also, probably the time of crypto is here too, so I should get a more bitcoin in the coming months (now that I missed the Ethereum rally).</p>
