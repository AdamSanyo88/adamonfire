title: I made a portfolio tracker

<p>There was one positive thing about the whole tariff ordeal and that is related to my preparedness to FIRE. Up until Trump's annoucement and the market meltdown, I thought that I have everything I need to monitor my portfolio. I had a master spreadsheet, Yahoo and Google Finance tracking, etc.<p/>
<p>The one thing I did not think about was the an actual, semi-automated way to track all my accounts. I did not realize that it is possible to set up tracking for most of my assets, or at least for the ones registered in major US and EU markets. So thanks to some magic in Google Sheets, now I have a master spreadsheet that tells me exactly my portfolio valuation in any given moment, and 70+% of my assets are automatically updated. This also makes my monthly review - which I changed to monthly from quarterly thanks to Trump - easier as I can tell exactly where my money goes, what my incoming balances are, etc.</p>
<p>The goal will be to create a good, 60-30-10 portfolio at the end of it. 60% will be going to stocks - probably the majority will still be US-focused ETFs, 30% to bonds - again mostly US, but some Hungarian bonds as well to ensure I have cash equivalent in local currency, and finally about 10% gold and bitcoin, this might be increased at the expense of bonds in the future (now that Bitcoin is going for the all-time high valuation, and gold is sort of becoming a reserve currency.</p>
<p>Finally, here are some charts on how my portfolio was slightly adjusted after Trump's "big, beautiful billboard" annoucement.</p>
