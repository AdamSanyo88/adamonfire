<p>So I was struggling with some Covid-like sickness for two weeks and then it took me another two weeks to recover. However, finally, I managed to find a sort of new hobby and that is to play basketball. I mean I just play on my own and try and score points, but it is actually a refreshing activity. I even bought a new smartwatch from Garmin to track my sleep and time my practice sessions with days when I sleep better. And the good thing is that it works. Whenever I managed to sleep 7.5-8 hours, I just throw better.<p/>
<p>I even told my wife that this court was built just for me - I found the place few weeks ago by accident -, because I hardly ever see others on the court. So whenever I find the time, I just go and practice. Maybe this will be one of my recurring activities once I FIRE.</p>
<p>Because as I approach my FIRE date - a bit over a year to go now -, I keep thinking about routines and what to do once I retired. That was one my learnings from talking to the others who already reached FIRE; you need a routine. And I guess, since I won't be travelling 6 months a year, it will be rather 6 weeks instead, I will need to find things to do in my free time. Until then, I keep practicing my free throws and 3-pointers in basketball, and attend the monthly project meetings as usual. Only 12 more of those to go.</p>
